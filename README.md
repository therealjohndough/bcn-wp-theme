# Buffalo Cannabis Network WordPress Theme

A custom WordPress theme for Buffalo Cannabis Network - a marketing and community platform designed for the cannabis industry.

## Overview

This theme provides a robust, maintainable foundation for building a community-driven marketing platform. It includes modern WordPress best practices, responsive design, and custom post types specifically designed for community engagement.

## Local Testing Environments

### Run the Theme with Docker Compose (Recommended)

1. **Copy the environment template**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update the generated `.env` with secure passwords. The defaults expose the theme on port `8080`.
2. **Start WordPress and MySQL**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   The containers create a fresh WordPress install and mount this repository as `wp-content/themes/bcn-wp-theme`.
3. **Finish setup in the browser**
   - Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
   - Complete the WordPress installer
   - Activate **Buffalo Cannabis Network** under **Appearance → Themes**
4. **Stop the environment** when finished testing
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

> **Data persistence:** Database data is stored in the `db_data` Docker volume and uploads are kept in `wp-data/uploads/`, so your demo content survives container restarts.

### Provision a Codex Environment

Use ChatGPT’s [Codex environments](https://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/environments) to spin up a disposable test instance:

1. Click **Create environment** and choose a name such as `bcn-wp-theme`.
2. Set the **Repository** to this Git project (GitHub URL or your fork).
3. Choose the **Runtime** `Docker` and provide the following start command so Codex boots WordPress automatically:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env && docker compose up --build
   ```
4. (Optional) Add the `WP_PORT=8080` environment variable override if you need a different public port.
5. Save the environment. Codex will start the containers and forward the exposed port so you can open the WordPress installer directly from the session sidebar.

Once Codex finishes booting:

- Complete the WordPress installation wizard.
- Activate the theme from **Appearance → Themes**.
- Populate sample content (see recommendations later in this guide) to validate templates, CPT archives, and ACF layouts.

Stop the environment from the Codex dashboard when you are done to avoid unnecessary usage.

## Customization

### Theme Colors

You can customize these colors in:
1. WordPress Customizer (Appearance → Customize → Theme Colors)
2. Or directly in `style.css` under `:root` variables

### BCN Block Patterns
Two ready-made patterns are available under **Patterns → BCN** in the block editor:
- **Contact – Get in Touch (BCN)**
- **Stay Connected (BCN)**

If you don’t see them, ensure `includes/patterns.php` is loaded and `assets/css/patterns.css` is enqueued in `functions.php`.

## GitHub Actions: Deploy to SiteGround

There's a workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-siteground.yml` that will run on push to `main` and deploy a directory (by default `./build`) to SiteGround via `rsync` over SSH.

Required repository secrets:
- `SG_DEPLOY_KEY` - the private SSH key (PEM) used to authenticate to SiteGround. Paste the private key contents (NOT the public key).
- `SG_HOST` - SSH hostname for SiteGround (for example `ssh.buffalocannabisnetwork.com`).
- `SG_USER` - SSH username (for example `u2037-...`).
- `SG_PORT` - SSH port (for example `18765`). Optional; the workflow defaults to `18765` when unset.
- `SG_REMOTE_PATH` - remote path to deploy into (for example `/home/u2037-.../public_html/wp-content/themes/bcn-wp-theme`).
- `SG_SOURCE` - optional: local path to deploy. Defaults to `./build` if not set.

Optional secret:
- `DRY_RUN` - set to `1` to only print the rsync command during workflow runs (useful for testing).

How it works:
- On push to `main`, the workflow checks out the repo, prepares the SSH key from `SG_DEPLOY_KEY`, attempts an `npm ci`/`npm install` and `npm run build` if `package.json` exists, then runs `rsync` to copy the `SG_SOURCE` directory to the remote path.

Security note: keep `SG_DEPLOY_KEY` secret and never commit private keys into the repository. Use the GitHub repository settings to add secrets.

Local `.env` and deploy notes
-----------------------------

For local previews and for running the Docker Compose preview, create a `.env` file in the repository root with values similar to the `.env.example` file already included. Do NOT commit your `.env` file — it should remain local and out of version control.

Example `.env` entries (do not paste private keys here):

```env
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ChangeMe
MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress
MYSQL_USER=wordpress
MYSQL_PASSWORD=wordpress
WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=db
WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress
WORDPRESS_DB_USER=wordpress
WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=wordpress
```

To run the local preview (Docker must be installed):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set secure passwords for local use
./scripts/preview-start.sh
# When done:
./scripts/preview-stop.sh
```

Deploying to SiteGround (manual or CI)
-------------------------------------

The GitHub Action will deploy the `SG_SOURCE` path (defaults to `./build`) to the remote `SG_REMOTE_PATH` using the private key stored in the `SG_DEPLOY_KEY` repository secret. To perform a real deploy:

1. Generate an SSH key pair locally (if you don't already have one):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "deploy@yourhost" -f ~/.ssh/siteground_deploy_key
```

2. Add the public key (`~/.ssh/siteground_deploy_key.pub`) to your SiteGround account SSH authorized keys (SiteGround control panel -> SSH Keys).

3. Add the private key content to the `SG_DEPLOY_KEY` repository secret in GitHub (Settings → Secrets). Also set `SG_HOST`, `SG_USER`, `SG_PORT`, and `SG_REMOTE_PATH` as repo secrets or update the workflow to set those values.

4. Ensure the `SG_SOURCE` path exists and contains the files you want to deploy (for example, run `npm run build` or create a `build/` directory with the theme files). The workflow runs `npm ci` and `npm run build` when `package.json` exists by default.

If you prefer to deploy from your local machine, use `scripts/deploy-local.sh` which mirrors the CI deploy command but runs locally. It defaults to a dry-run and allows you to specify the SSH key path and remote destination.
