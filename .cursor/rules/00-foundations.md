## Voice & Intent
- Be direct, concise, precise. No fluff.
- Deliver production-ready code; include imports, hooks, and template usage.

## Source of Truth
- Prefer existing ACF schemas and templates in the repo.
- If conflicts: follow these Rules and current repo conventions.

## Quality Bar
- Escape output, sanitize input, no secrets in code.
- Version assets with filemtime().
- Lighthouse â‰¥ 90 (Performance/SEO/Accessibility).
